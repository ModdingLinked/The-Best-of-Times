From NoBark:
Fixed an extra meshes folder in the paths for grenaderiflelongbarrelmerc.nif and grenaderiflemerc.nif, without missing meshes this time
Fixed alpha bug in ashpile01.nif, goopile01.nif, goopile02.nif, nvashpile01.nif, and nvashpile03.nif
Restored the .45 submachine gun from 3.3.2, fixing the flipped iron sights
Fixed the busted All American sticker in 1st person
Fixed the broken Single Barrel Shotgun shell texture

From Ungeziefi:
Added patched executable hashes as valid for the various platforms, verifying game files is now required only if you decompressed BSAs
Better wording and more information in the installer, including failure messages
Added a check that prevents installation if the user doesn't have enough free storage in the destination folder
Fixed broken progress in the challenge "The Bigger They Are..." due to wrong comparison signs in BehemothAchievementSCRIPT and MQ01BehemothSCRIPT
Fixed Behemoth in Evergreen Mills not turning hostile if the electrified gate is disabled via the manual switch instead of destroying the generator, EvergreenMillsFenceGate01SCRIPT was only checking for the generator's destroyed status instead of the gate XMarker state
Fixed 3 misplaced lights in the Union A&P Station:
10012E4E
10012E5C
10012E5D
Applied the "No LOD Water" flag to TheStripWorldNew for better performance, making Aqua Performa redundant
Reduced the particle lifetime of all Snow Globes from 33 to 12 seconds for better performance, making Snow Globes Performance Fix redundant (+40% on a 5800X3D system while CPU bound)
From Stentorious:
Fixed the script lag occurring in cells with numerous gas traps. Adding the scripts edits needed to the TTW plugin means removing the existing script optimization from YUPTTW to not have it overwrite (01010DAB)

From dhert:
Fixed Super Stimpaks affecting the "Stimpaks Taken" Misc stat and playing the Addiction01ISFX IMOD if used by an NPC

From Hairy:
Fixed some missing "No Voice Filter" flags causing Shorty to die when not supposed to. Also fixed a missing "ShortyRef.SetRestrained 0"
Switched to a more reliable method to disable NPCs in Anchorage entering the main tent
Fixed broken "Project Impurity" quest completion due to missing SetStage functions in 2 of Lyon's dialogue lines

From BarryThePirate:
Fixed InitExtraMiscStat by setting a variable to 1 after it's init instead of relying on GetGameRestarted. This also fixes the perception assignment bug for characters using Four Eyes and some weapon crafting returning nothing

From boltik61:
Fixed the Lawbringer challenges bug

From NoBark:
Improved the light node position in Pip-Boy meshes, to avoid leaking
Fixed an extra meshes folder in the paths for grenaderiflelongbarrelmerc.nif and grenaderiflemerc.nif
Fixed sprtel wood's firing sound

Added envmap_fade to a light shining in darkness so it doesn't glow
Fixed miscolored sleeves on male combat armors
Fixed busted textures on sprtel wood and pewpew's clip
Fixed texture issue with the sierra madre security armor and reverted changes to the helmet

From Ungeziefi:
Tiny improvements to the installer backend and wording, some tag cleanup as well
Added a check to prevent installation if FNV is in Program Files, as the guide expects it elsewhere to avoid issues (added instructions in the 2nd upload of 3.3.3a)

From DevvEloper:
Fixed the dialogue where you can ask Mr. Crowley about the real reason he wants Tenpenny, Dave, Dukov and the other guy killed, after you hear rumors of them being no bigots (3rd upload of 3.3.3a)</textarea>

From Hairy:
Fixed a GNR BOS guard to not go hostile towards the player and cause the BOS in the area to go hostile as well
Fixed the faction relationship between the GNR BOS and the Player (None existed)
Restored Behemoth to throw boulders
Fixed to account for if the vault 101 overseer's office door is locked/unlocked/lock broken or has the key or not when talking to the Overseer before leaving the vault
Fixed to account for if the vault 101 overseer's terminal is hacked/locked out or has the password or not when talking to the Overseer before leaving the vault
Fixed the vault 101 overseer to only give the player his office key and/or password depending on if the player has them, or door is still locked, or terminal hacked, etc
Fixed the dialogue topic "Oh, great. Let me guess, more psychotic little girls..." the player says to Protector McGraw to appear only if the player completes the Tranquility Lane quest. Not stage 70 of Picking Up The Trail quest
Fixed Butch to not call for Officer Kendall if he's dead. In the scenario when the player refuses to help Butch save her mom from Radroaches, then Butch calls for Officer Kendall
Fixed/Reverted back to vanilla 3 dialogue lines with The Brain that cut the topic choices out involving The Brain rewarding the player with death
Fixed The Brain's robots that wouldn't attack involving 4 dialogue lines
Fixes Lucas Simms not attacking the player when messing with him in the first conversation. Figured out a much easier simpler solution without altering anything else
Fixed the dialogue line "Enclave troops have fortified the purifier complex. With those vertibirds, they're able to transport personnel at a remarkable rate." to not appear too early. There was no condition for them appearing in the Wasteland yet
Fixed the dialogue line "They're savage! They're brutal! They're here to keep this worker in his place -- the undefeated Bear Brothers!" to cut out "his" since there's no female line
Fixed the dialogue line "Let's find out if the newcomer can hold his own against real fighters! Release! Fight!" to cut out "his own" since there's no female line
Fixed the dialogue prompt "Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny." to not appear when Tenpenny is dead
Fixed the dialogue line "Oh my... It's brilliant! Even I'm astounded by my genius! No, it's more than that. By OUR genius!" Moira says that was missing some words in the subtitles
Fixed the dialogue line "It's named after Allistair Tenpenny, who runs this building. Got a bunch of rich guys that pay him to live in it." for one of the voice types that said "He's got" in the audio file
Fixed the dialogue prompt "You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?" to show up when asking Zip
Fixed Jenny Wilson to be blocked from kid karma greetings to not access her unvoiced dialogue topics
Fixed/Reworked Ymir's bartender scene to block the player. If the player attacked PF before the bar tender scene ended, then killed Ymir, the player was unable to open his corpse inventory
Fixed all the beds in the PF Slaver Barracks. Including ownership fixes and assigning Ymir/Jotun their routine bed locations
Fixed all the karma Hello/Greeting PF resident dialogue lines
Restored Atomization Critical on death effect for nuke weapons
Added the Player shielding eyes and stagger from the Megaton explosion only if in 3rd person camera view. 1st person these idles will not trigger
Injected/Restored "Who do we have here?" as the 1st dialogue line for Burke's first force greet to the player in the Saloon
Fixed being able to tell Mister Burke yourself that you disarmed the bomb if he didn't see you do it if he was in a Megaton interior, and the player hasn't told Lucas Simms yet "I've disarmed the bomb, Burke. That thing will never explode now."
Fixed Burke to force a confrontation if he hasn't yet and the player told Lucas Simms the bomb is disarmed ending the quest (Opportunity to tell Burke yourself that the bomb is disarmed is lost since when the quest ends, the quest dialogue involved is gone)
Fixed Mister Burke to confront the player when the bomb is disarmed, he's in the Megaton WorldSpace (not in an interior), and the player hasn't told Lucas Simms yet
Fixed Burke's Hitmen to only appear in random encounters if Burke actually knows the bomb is disarmed and he threatened the player, or the player made him mad
Fixed/Restored the dialogue line "Do it! Detonate the bomb and together we'll usher in a new age of prosperity!"
Burke randomly says to the player on the Balcony when waiting to blow up Megaton
Fixed most of Burke's random Hello/Greeting dialogue to account for the new changes
Fixed/Adjusted Burkes AI behavior for some of his packages (able to say Hello dialogue, ignoring combat he's not involved in, etc)
Fixed Bleak's Greeting dialogue if the player killed the PF NPC guards beforehand. She said the incorrect generic line "What do you need?"
Fixed Cutter to be included in the PF hostile scripting. She'll be hostile no matter what if the player attacks PF NPCs, or attacking her triggers all the PF NPCs to go hostile
Fixed Cutter's leveled item weapon to not be a raider style, NPC one
Fixed all the Big Town residents to do cheer animations for all their dialogue lines when the player returns Red/Shorty and after the invading super mutants die
Fixed Kimba and Bittercup to lay mines when the player teaches them how to lay mines. They just stood there doing nothing. Weapon drawn flag on their AI behavior was preventing them to do it
Fixed all the Big Town residents except Flash to place their mines in the exact spots. Their dedicated spots weren't assigned
Fixed Flash, Kimba, and Shorty to follow Red like the others when learning how to sneak, lay a mine, or see the robots get repaired. Missing packages
Fixed Timebomb to sneak when the player teaches Big Town residents. No scripting existed for it in his script
Fixed the dialogue line "Thanks for helping us. I just hope we can survive another attack. Probably won't." Big Town residents say to require talking to the player already to not interfere with their first dialogue lines
Fixed the dialogue line "Wow. I can't believe that you were able to help Timebomb. And here I was sure that you were ready to just let him die. I guess I had you wrong." Red says to the player to require angering her beforehand
Fixed the free healing option "Heal me up, Red." with Red to show up if the player saved TimeBomb
Fixed the dialogue line "Well, I'll be damned... That little so-and-so... why didn't I think of that when I was sixteen?" Mr. Brotch says to himself when seeing Wally's GOAT test to trigger before or after the player turns in his/her test
Fixed the dialogue prompt "You know what? Forget I said anything." choices to have the correct response from the topic "Out there in the Wastes, man. You must be bored to tears in this town." with Jericho
Fixes to hiring RL3 through Tinker Joe's dialogue involving karma, TTW's speech perk, and having a companion or not
Fixed 8 PF residents that should be in the ParadiseFallsSlaverFaction
Fixed Jotun to have the ParadiseFallsSlaverScript assigned like all the other PF residents. This properly makes all the PF residents hostile if the player attacks him. Also adds to the kill count of how many guards have been killed
Fixed Jotun to not warn/attack the player when near Ymir in the Slaver Barracks
Fixed Clover, Crimson, and the Child Slaver that was missing the PF hostile scripting if the player attacks them
Fixed all the PF residents to not go hostile if the player attacks them if they're already dead and the player didn't kill them
Fixed 2 lines with Maggie
Disabled/Fixed the player being unable to mezz captives. Player can't talk those NPCs and mezzing NPCs requires initiating dialogue
Fixed 2 subtitle mismatches with Bill Seward
Fixes 2 speech check failure lines with Macready
Fixed the dialogue line "Moriarty pisses in his still -- crazy bastard thinks it's hilarious. Besides, you'll get your throat cut in that pit. You're much better off here." Andy Stahl says to the player to require him being in The Brass Lantern
Fixed Silver to only force a dialogue greeting to the player when either the player hasn't talked to Moriarty yet, or the player has and Moriarty asked for a favor. Talking to Moriarty but not asking for a favor will result in no forced greeting and no available topics to appear. No topics exist for Silver in that scenario
Fixed the dialogue greeting "Yeah? What is it?" Silver says to the player to trigger when the side quest with her isn't active
Fixed 3 dialogue options the player says to Silver after Moriarty asks for a favor, to require Moriarty asking the player for a favor
Fixed the dialogue prompt "You don't still offer your... services, do you?" the player says to Silver to require the favor being resolved
Fixed the dialogue prompt "What will you do now?" the player says to Silver to require the favor being resolved
Fixed Pronto's vendor chest upgrade to add the stimpacks that it originally had before the upgrade (Developers forgot to add it back in)
Fixed the dialogue prompt "Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?" the player says to random Citadel NPCs to not appear anymore when the player already has permission from Elder Lyons
Fixed any related power armor training topics from showing up if the player already has the Power Armor Training perk
Fixed being able to fast travel freely from the The Temple Of The Union after the player tells Hannibal Hamlin to promise to not reveal their location
Fixed a gate and a door to be unlocked inside the Farragut West Station at the start of The Temple Of The Union journey to the Memorial. They blocked the NPCs path to get there
Fixed 2 slavers that are killed on purpose when Walker begins traveling to the Temple to be accounted for. Depending on where the player goes, they could easily not get counted as dead in scripting which easily broke the quest
Fixed the quest Head Of State objective "Kill all the slavers near the Lincoln Memorial." target conditions
Fixed the quest Head Of State objective "Join Leroy Walker in attacking the Temple of the Union." target conditions
Fixed Hannibal to not warn/attack the player when in the Temple for no reason. His guard package behavior didn't have the "no warn/attack" behavior flag on
Fixed Hannibal to switch to his guard package behavior after speaking to the player once and the player didn't promise yet
Fixed Hannibal to switch to his guard defend package behavior when the slavers are going to attack. Incorrect conditions
Fixed Silas to be part of the Paradise Falls Slaver Faction like the rest of the Memorial slavers
Fixed/Added missing scripting for when Walker and his other slavers go back to Paradise Falls. Including PF hostile scripting and adding to the guard count deaths
Fixed The Temple Of The Union to go hostile towards the player if the player picklocks the front gate before telling Hannibal Hamlin to promise to not reveal their location and doesn't have the key yet
Fixed The Temple Of The Union to go hostile towards the player if the player enters The Temple Of The Union then escapes before telling Hannibal Hamlin to promise to not reveal their location
Fixed the dialogue prompt "Not around here, but there is a group of them up north near Old Olney." the player says to Leroy Walker to appear if the player stepped foot inside the Temple Of The Union, hasn't betrayed the Temple yet, and the Temple isn't on their journey yet
Fixed the dialogue prompt "I'm looking for runaway slaves." the player says to Simone to only appear after agreeing to help Walker find Hannibal. Not if the player talked to Walker once. Also fixed so it sets the player as an enemy towards the Temple, not just starting combat with Simone only
Fixed the dialogue prompt "Actually, I already know he's up north, near Old Olney." the player says to Leroy Walker to appear if the player entered the Temple, talked to Hannibal, and the Temple hasn't begun their journey yet
Fixed the dialogue prompt "Maybe. How much is it worth to find these slaves for you?" the player says to Leroy Walker to appear if the player hasn't agreed to find Hannibal yet. Not if Hannibal has asked the player to help or not
Fixed the dialogue prompt "That's a really stupid idea." choices the player says to Hannibal
Fixed the dialogue greeting "So the Super Mutants are dead? This is wonderful news!" Hannibal says to the player to always trigger when he asked the player to go to the Memorial and returning back knowing the super mutants are dead
Fixed the dialogue line "Yeah, I killed them all after telling you not to." Walker says to the player to be a goodbye
Fixed the dialogue line "That's close enough. What the hell are you doing wandering around here?" Silas says to the player to set the player knowing the super mutants are dead. Obviously talking to the slavers the player knows they're dead and makes sense with the prompts towards Hannibal when returning the news
Fixed the dialogue line "The slaves know their place now, thanks to you." Walker says to the player to not be a goodbye that blocked topics showing up to sell Lincoln artifacts to him
Fixed the dialogue line "You have been good to your word. You are welcome at the Temple of the Union anytime." Hannibal says to the player to be a goodbye
Fixed the dialogue line "Stay sharp. The Wasteland is dangerous." Simone Cameron says to the player to trigger while traveling to the Memorial (incorrect condition)
Fixed 6 dialogue lines involving Hannibal being informed of what's going on at the Memorial. Including prompts only appearing once telling him the super mutants are dead, soldiers are there, slavers are there, or slavers are dead. New developments can be chosen, but repeating the same news in different ways won't appear since he already knows
Fixed/Added a new dialogue line to say to Hannibal to account for when the player killed all the Slavers before agreeing to help Hannibal. No choice existed for that circumstance
Fixed all the Temple Of The Union NPC greetings when they're near the memorial, and they'll only say those lines when all 8 slavers aren't dead yet
Fixed all the Temple Of The Union NPC greetings when the slavers are near the Temple, and they'll only say those lines when all 8 slavers aren't dead yet (Only 6 show up but the counter in the coding is still 8)
Fixed all the Temple Of The Union NPC greetings when the player talks to Hannibal once, and before promising to him, to not be goodbyes to unlock a dialogue topic
Restored/Fixed the dialogue prompt "Hannibal wants me to promise to keep this place safe. Why should I do that?" the player asks to all Temple Of The Union NPCs after talking to Hannibal once and before promising to Hannibal
Restored/Fixed the dialogue prompt "What's the story with Hannibal?" the player asks to all Temple Of The Union NPCs after promising to Hannibal
Fixed/Adjusted Dukov, Cherry, and Fantasia's behavior when outside to ignore enemies nearby and combat they're not involved in
Fixed/Added being able to tell Lucy West her parents are dead and updated information on her brother Ian after the Blood Ties quest if she doesn't know yet still
Fixed Mabel Henderson's robot to not stay hostile after switching the robot back to normal on the terminal inside her house
Added a new Pristine Nuka Machine Key to the game (Roy request)
Added the Pristine Nuka Machine Key to Sierra's inventory (Roy request)
Pristine Nuka Machine Key unlocks Sierra's Pristine Vending Machine (Roy request)
Added the Schematics - Nuka-Cocktail to Sierra when she dies (It won't get added if the player already received it from her through dialogue)(Roy request)

From Hairy:
Fixed Red to force greet the player quickly after unlocking her jail cell, and regardless of talking to her beforehand
Fixed Red and Shorty's reunion conversation to only trigger when Red is rescued so it doesn't interrupt Red's force greet
Fixed/Improved blocking the player from interrupting Brotch/kids while the kids turn in their GOAT tests to not break their dialogue lines. Player can turn in his/her GOAT test once while the other kids are turning theirs in. Added a check just in case the player can't after they all turn in their tests
Fixed/Restored Haley to force greet the player when the player enters his shop for the 1st time
Fixed/Restored Haley's sandbox routine in his shop
Fixed Haley's combat style to ranged since his main weapon is the Hunting Rifle
Fixed/Restored the Overseer radio station during The Trouble On The Homefront quest. The restored station is called "Radio 101". By default they set it up so either music or the Overseer announcements play each time from a random percentage
Fixed the restored Overseer radio station to play when the player is able to hear amata's distress emergency call (only within the Vault 101 interiors by default for that station)
Fixed the restored Overseer radio station to loop its music or announcements continuously
Fixed the restored Overseer radio station to get disabled after the quest is over and the player left the vault
Fixed the dialogue option "Interested in buying some scrap metal?" towards Walter to only show up if the player agreed to his offer
Fixed the Protecting the Water Way quest to account for if the player won the duel against Split Jack, has the option to extort Lepelletier, and than kills the gang afterwards
Fixed Anchorage, The Pitt, Point Lookout, and Zeta to not re-enable the Enclave Radio Station after the Take It Back quest has been completed, when traveling back to the Wasteland from them.
Fixed the dialogue option "I hear there's a door that doesn't work." towards Joseph to not appear anymore after he repairs the terminal
Fixed the quest objective target for the Vault 87 back door terminal to be set off when the Vault 87 back door is unlocked
Fixed the quest objective target for Joseph to be set off after he repairs the Vault 87 back door terminal

Fixed the dialogue option "Do you suspect your family is in danger?" to Lucy West to not appear after she knows her parents are dead
Fixed the dialogue option "Lucy, I have bad news. Your parents are dead." to Lucy West to not appear after she knows her parents are dead and to also set that she knows her parents are dead
Fixed Gustavo's greeting line "Hmph. Didn't think you had it in you. Guess you proved me wrong. Good job. Knowing those Ghouls are gone takes a load off my mind. Thanks. You'll be wanting the reward now, won't you? I suppose you've earned it. There's your caps. Contract fulfilled, debt paid. This don't mean we're buddies, alright? Now get going." to be a dialogue choice. It has a prompt "The Ghouls trying to get in are all dead." that wasn't used since it was a greeting. Also fixed so it only pops up after accepting the job to take care of the ghouls and the player killed Bessie, Michael, and Roy. This also makes sense towards what he says and the player can receive a proper reward amount from negotiating the job beforehand
Fixed the quest objective "Kill Roy Phillips and his followers." or "Kill Roy Phillips and his followers, or Help the Ghouls get into Tenpenny Tower." or "Help the Ghouls get into Tenpenny Tower, or Kill Roy Phillips and his followers." to only get completed after accepting the job from Gustavo and the player killed Bessie, Michael, and Roy

Fixed/Blocked dialogue towards asking if the Ghouls might move in or if the neighbors want them to move in when the player already killed them
Fixed all the dialogue options to accept the job for Gustavo to be goodbyes. This is so the quest can update outside of dialogue and incorrect options won't show up when going back to the main options
Fixed Michael Masters and Bessie Lynn to not get moved to Tenpenny if they're dead and the ferals are released
Fixed the Tenpenny Tower to not get repaired if Bessie, Michael, and Roy are all dead. There's no one to repair the Tower
Fixed responses in the topic "Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?" to not popup if Roy is mentioned and he's dead
Fixed the GNR Radio reports that talk about the Ghouls trying to move in to check for if they're dead or haven't moved in yet`
Fixed/Repositioned the Raven Rock map marker that was underground. This caused followers/teammates to spawn underground when fast traveling to it, especially if the player had multiple followers/teammates
Fixed Sydney's chair in Underworld to set ownership for her after the Stealing Independence quest is completed. This prevents other NPCs sitting in it and there's already an EditorID for it as well
Fixed Susan to not live in Burke's place too early and only when the Ghouls have moved in. The player could still decide to kill the Ghouls at the time the developers set it up
Fixed it so Fawkes doesn't move from his original position in Vault 87 if there are enemies nearby
Fixed a typo in Three Dog's dialogue
Fixed the Child Slaver's greeting line "Nice as the weather is out here, how about you bring me a kid, so I can get back to Paradise Falls?" to only be triggered before having Bumble following the player
Fixed the Child Slaver's greeting line "Just waiting for you to bring me a new friend." to only be triggered before having Bumble following the player
Fixed the Child Slaver's greeting line "Just bring me a nice kid to meet, and I'll take care of the rest." to only be triggered before having Bumble following the player
Fixed the Child Slaver to have default slaver greeting lines after handing off Bumble to her
Fixed Bumble's dialogue topic "No, I don't like the outside!" to not show up when outside of Little Lamplight
Fixed the Child At Heart and speech challenge dialogue options towards Bumble to not add a script package. The package is already on her NPC record
Fixed Bumble to immediately run back into Little Lamplight and fail the sidequest, if the player shoots the Child Slaver while Bumble is following the player
Fixed Bumble to immediately run back into Little Lamplight and fail the sidequest, if the Child Slaver dies
Fixed Bumble to immediately flee or run back into Little Lamplight and fail the sidequest, if the player shoots Bumble
Fixed to fail the sidequest if the player shoots Bumble at any time
Fixed to fail the sidequest if the player shoots the Child Slaver at any time
Fixed the Child Slaver to start combat with the player if she sees the player shoot Bumble
Fixed Bumble to remove her slave collar at any time the sidequest fails and she retreats back to Little Lamplight
Fixed/Blocked the player from interrupting the Child Slaver and Bumble's conversation
Fixed Bumble to follow the player through the Little Lamplight exterior door (sometimes she failed to follow)
Fixed Bumble and the Child Slaver to get disabled if they make it to Paradise Falls worldspace (only possible if the player follows them to Paradise Falls)
Fixed the Child Slaver to get disabled if the player fails the sidequest inside Little Lamplight
Fixed Bumble's AI to ignore combat she isn't involved in
Fixed Bumble and the Child Slaver's follow/escort packages to avoid radiation in the Wasteland
Fixed/Restored Mister Burke to be involved in the Tenpenny attack only if he's currently living in the Tenpenny Tower (waiting to blowup Megaton is another route for him)
Fixed/Restored Mister Burke to be involved in the Tenpenny "peaceful" massacre only if he's currently living in the Tenpenny Tower
Fixed Mister Burke to go to Tenpenny Tower uninterrupted after he threatens the player then exits Megaton. If the Tenpenny attack is going on during that time, he will wait outside in the Tenpenny patio area until the Tower is repaired
Fixed the dialogue line "Back again, hmm? Perhaps you've reconsidered my offer?" Mister Burke says to not show up if you talk to him twice after disarming the bomb and haven't talked to Simms yet
Fixed the dialogue line "Don't hurt me!" Mister Burke says to only to be said inside Tenpenny Tower during the attack
Fixed the dialogue line "Help us!" Mister Burke says to only to be said inside Tenpenny Tower during the attack
Fixed the Tenpenny gate intercom to not have the guard talk to the player at the beginning of the feral attack. NPCs all moved into the Tower and it was checking if that guard was dead yet
Fixed the dialogue option "Guess what I have for you?" to Agatha to not appear yet before talking about getting music paper for her
Fixed Marguerite's dialogue greetings towards the Still being repaired to not trigger until talking about the job beforehand
Fixed Crowley knowing or not knowing whether the player told him the targets are dead or alive, including lying to him

Fixed vertibird platforms in raven rock so they play their sounds again.
Fixed a random issue where Three Dog announces he's going to play a song and then skips it entirely.

Fixed the dialogue response "I guess I don't mind those Ghouls as much as I thought I would." Tiffany Cheng says to the player to only be said when the Ghouls move into Tenpenny Tower

Fixed Sammy to pace back and forth inside the slave pen before he gets Squirrel to talk to the player
Fixed Sammy and Squirrel to stop walking into each other trying to reach the spot next to the barb wire fence opening
Fixed Sammy to run to the sewer grate exit next to the kids when he's outside already, slavers are hostile, and having the quest objective displayed "Meet the children southwest of Paradise Falls."

Fixed the kids (Sammy, Squirrel, Penny) confidence levels to be reverted back after completing the Escape From PF quest

Fixed Rory's greeting line "Hey. Talk fast, they hate it when I talk to customers." to be a goodbye line. He has no more dialogue options to choose from when in Megaton
Fixed/Restored the dialogue option "No luck yet." to Squirrel when the player hasn't distracted or killed Forty yet
Fixed/Restored the dialogue option "Pipe down, shorty. I'm going to take care of it." to Squirrel when the player hasn't distracted or killed Forty yet
Fixed the Little Lamplight kid's dialogue responses to account for if the player rescued Sammy and Squirrel, but not Penny
