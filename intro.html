            Introduction
                <p>Welcome to The Best of Times, a fully modular vanilla-plus modding guide for Tale of Two Wastelands!</p>
        </h2>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            IMPORTANT: Everything in this guide is written down for a reason! It is vital to read <b>everything!</b>
            You can NOT skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.

            <p class="subparagraph">
                    The Best of Times is a modding guide for A Tale of Two Wastelands that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth, and most importantly, enjoyable experience.
                    Unlike other modding guides, it is built with customization in mind. Mods are subjective, so every mod listed in the guide is 100% optional.
                    A hand-made load order, and it will still work if you skipped any mods.
                    <br> <br>
                    The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. It has meticulously-detailed instructions, with additional notes, explanations, and/or images for the more complex instructions.
                    It is incredibly important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them.
                    There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide,
                    it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.
            </p>
        <a class="internallink" href="#about"><h2 class="subheader" id="about">About the Guide</h2></a>
            <a class="internallink" href="#features"><p class="smallheader" id="features">Features:</p></a>
                <ul class="standard_ul">
                    <li>
                        <b>Stability:</b>
                            Don't let crashing be a core feature of the game anymore! The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                            With a complete install of the guide, you should have zero crashes! Of course there are no guarantees with Fallout, but a majority of
                            guide users report 0-2 crashes over the course of an entire playthrough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance:</b>
                            Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance.
                            No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no heavily-scripted weather mods, or any other unoptimized/broken mods.
                            New Vegas Tick Fix, a mod in the guide, also allows for playing at framerates over 60FPS without the notorious physics bugs!
                            With my mid-range PC at 1080p resolution, I get around 120 FPS everywhere except for the most intensive (and unoptimized) areas like The Strip, where it stays around 90 FPS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Better Gameplay:</b>
                            The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's lore.
                            Many modern features have been added, such as a quick-loot menu, dynamic crosshair, and hit markers, without adding any features that don't fit the RPG-style or unbalance the game.
                            The game will be much more difficult than vanilla New Vegas/3, without being too frustrating or cheesy.
                            The lower difficulty settings will also still be viable for those who prefer the RPG elements of the game to the combat elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Custom Mods and Patches:</b>
                            When needed, the guide will provide custom mods, addendums to existing mods, or patches for mods to make them compatible and consistent with the guide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Customizability:</b>
                            The guide is fully modular, every mod listed is 100% optional. A hand-made load order be provided, and it will work perfectly even if you left out any mods.
                            For information regarding adding your own mods, see the <a href="./intro.html#additional_mods">Additional Mods</a> section below.

                <p class="subparagraph">
                    The guide will make the game run much better than vanilla. As the game is ten years old, you do not need a very strong PC to run it.
                    The game is much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive. Installing the game on an SSD can drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering.
                    Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS in 1080p:
                    <br> <br>
                        <ul class="standard_ul">
                            <li><b>CPU:</b> Any dual-core processor (2.5GHz or more)</li>
                            <li><b>RAM:</b> 4GB of RAM (speed shouldn't effect much)</li>
                            <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 600 series card or an AMD 5500 series card</li>
